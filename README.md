# 🎲 RNG Data Sorter

This repository contains the RNG Data Sorter project, a university assessment from the University of Central Lancashire. The project focuses on analyzing the performance of three sorting algorithms—Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and QuickSort—on datasets of varying sizes. Through this analysis, we aim to understand the efficiency and practicality of each sorting algorithm under different conditions. 📊

## 📝 Project Overview

The RNG Data Sorter generates random datasets of three different sizes: 100, 1,000, and 10,000 elements. Each element in the datasets is a six-digit number ranging from 100,000 to 999,999. The project applies Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and QuickSort to these datasets to evaluate and compare their performance. The primary metrics for comparison are the execution time in milliseconds and the number of comparisons made during the sorting process.
